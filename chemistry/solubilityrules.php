<li>Salts containing Group I elements are soluble (Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Rb+). Salts containing the ammonium ion (NH4+) are also soluble.</li>
<li>Salts containing nitrate ion (NO3-) are generally soluble.</li> 
<li>Salts containing Cl -, Br -, I - are generally soluble. Important exceptions to this rule are halide salts of Ag+, Pb2+, and (Hg2)2+. Thus, AgCl, PbBr2, and Hg2Cl2 are all insoluble.</li>
<li>Most silver salts are insoluble. AgNO3 and Ag(C2H3O2) are common soluble salts of silver; virtually anything else is insoluble.</li>
<li>Most sulfate salts are soluble. Important exceptions to this rule include BaSO4, PbSO4, Ag2SO4 and SrSO4.</li>
<li>Most hydroxide salts are only slightly soluble. Hydroxide salts of Group I elements are soluble. Hydroxide salts of Group II elements (Ca, Sr, and Ba) are slightly soluble. Hydroxide salts of transition metals and Al3+ are insoluble. Thus, Fe(OH)3, Al(OH)3, Co(OH)2 are not soluble.</li>
<li>Most sulfides of transition metals are highly insoluble. Thus, CdS, FeS, ZnS, Ag2S are all insoluble. Arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and lead sulfides are also insoluble.</li>
<li>Carbonates are frequently insoluble. Group II carbonates (Ca, Sr, and Ba) are insoluble. Some other insoluble carbonates include FeCO3 and PbCO3.</li>
<li>Chromates are frequently insoluble. Examples: PbCrO4, BaCrO4.</li>
<li>Phosphates are frequently insoluble. Examples: Ca3(PO4)2, Ag3PO4.</li>
<li>Fluorides are frequently insoluble. Examples: BaF2, MgF2 PbF2.</li>
